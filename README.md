# Omniscience-Fabric
A fabric mod that reveals invisible entities.

It also works on servers and is not detectable as long as you wont stand out to much.
_(Even though servers could be modded in a way so that they wont send any player entity data if the player is invisible)_

###### This mod runs on Fabric and requires the Fabric API: [How to install](https://fabricmc.net/ "How to install")
